## the pitch

A portal to a new world has just opened, we have no idea how it works.

Teams of brave explorers are entering the portal to try to figure out what
the world has in store.

Prepare yourself with equipment from the normal world, go in, establish routes
and expand into the unknown. Create paths, gather resources to create new gear 
never seen before, note down new creatures and their effects, 
and use the environment to your advantage!

## Introduction

*PROJECTNAME* is a game about exploring an unknown new world, and learning
the ways of this new dimension. You will need to think differently about
how to go about situations, because the rules of the world are different to
the normal one. You will find beatiful and horrible things beyond your 
imagination.

## Core loop
Prepare to go into the portal. Set up your inventory to move the next step
in the journey deeper into the new world. Go in, explore, gather things,
build bridges/ropes/ladders/minetracks/what is needed to continue further
into the cave. Return out with new things and further progression.
Use your new things and knowledge to get further into the mysteries that 
the new world has to offer.

## Story

TODO

## Gameplay
Very exploration and knowledge focused. It should be exciting to find new
things. 

You get things that help you traverse the world faster.
Very lategame maybe even portals/teleportation devices.

Interesting items with strange behaviours (See Made in abyss relics).

Learn about how the world works, and deal with it accordingly.


## Feeling

Top down RPG vibes, pokemon type look. Surreal, japanese (wii sports),
wildly different music depending on what is happening. Would love some
sick breakcore and uboa type noise for some parts. Art is in grayscale, then
colored in with color palettes depending on area.

Non euclidian spaces, strange behaviors, rain falling upwards, 
infinite hallways, that kind of thing.

## Thoughts

Resource gathering/crafting is very overdone, is there some other way
to do it? Is it fine in this context because we are doing it in a special
way?

I want to focus on exploring and the creating of the path forward.
I loved the feeling I got after creating a minetrack/teleporter in terraria.
