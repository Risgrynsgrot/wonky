##  Plans
* UI
** system with support for lists of buttons. that's the main thing for now
** potential support for lua, more dynamic and easier to iterate.

* Lua support, think it could be cool for modding support and easy iteration, hot reloading?
* Reworking into better ecs system
* the game itself lol
* Level loading via LdTk or Tiled

## The game itself
Chill multiplayer game, cross between progressiony games like terraria/factorio, animal crossing and runescape

Walk around, interact, use items.

## Style
I like the idea of a bit of a surreal theme, to allow for weird stuff.

Modern things like elevators, buttons, machines. But also magic things like
portals and such.
